# What is this?
This is an academic project.

WeNote is a mobile application written in React Native where people can create notes and share them with others. From there, anyone who has access to a note can read it and edit it as well, making it a sort of collaborative notepad. The application uses websockets to tell the user what's going on in real time, this includes detecting if anyone's editing a file, and various notifications.

This application works in conjunction with the server from ---.


# My responsibilities
During the development of this project, I was responsible for organizing the overall structure, as well as designing and developing the underlying mechanics of the program. This includes server communication, and most inter-component communication. I was also responsible for some UI development, such as the UserCard component.


# Setup
To setup the server's IP, you should change the variable SERVER_ADDRESS (settings.js). This IP cannot be the loopback ip, but it can be the LAN ip. After that, run the server and the application is ready to be launched.


# Run
After clone, run `npm install`


# Grade
The application was graded with a 95/100.
